# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my first git project! I am a young web dev starting bootcamp and this is our prework project before starting class. I am very excited about learning all about development.
It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
